# AngularJS Custom MultiSelect Dropdown Directive
AngularJS multiselect dropdown directive originally developed by [Stephen Long](https://github.com/long2know/angular-directives-general) for his blog. Due to the fact that I have made several changes to the directive and my recent decision to move to the new Angular 8, I have decided to move this custom version of the original to npm repository.

All credits to [Stephen Long](https://github.com/long2know/angular-directives-general) for devoloping the original version of this directive.
